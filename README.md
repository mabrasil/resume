> Pretty much of a normal resumé written in plain *markdown* and generated in
other formats like `.pdf`, `.docx` and `.tex`.

## About me

Hey, my name's Matheus :)

If you wanna know more about me, you're probably in the right place! I'd recommend
you reading one of the available markdown versions of my resumé:

- [English](resumes/markdown/en.md)

### Adobe PDF

- [Brazilian Portuguese](resumes/pdf/pt.pdf)

### Microsoft Word

- [English](resumes/word/en.docx)
- [Brazilian Portuguese](resumes/word/pt.docx)
