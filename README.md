## About me

Hello, I’m *Matheus Albuquerque* - or *Matheus Brasil*, if you prefer. I'm a full stack developer who lives in [Fortaleza, CE](http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortaleza).

I started playing with programming at the age of 11 - not actually much ago - and since then I’ve played with a considerable amount of languages, from mainstream ones like Java, C#, Ruby, Python, Brainfuck - yeah, for me it's a mainstream one - and JavaScript (<3), passing by <strike>lovable</strike> functional ones like Haskell, Elixir, Erlang and Clojure to really <strike>weird</strike> esoteric ones like Shakespeare, LOLCODE, 4Lang, ZOMBIE etc.

As you may know I consider myself a *web alchemist* who's always trying new technologies and specially playing with cool stuff. Nowadays I try to be as active as possible at local communities like [Dev I/O Fortaleza](https://www.facebook.com/groups/fortalezadevelopers/), [Ionic Brazil](http://ionicbrazil.com/), [The Lambda I/O Foundation](https://github.com/lambda-io), [JS4Girls Fortaleza](http://js4girls-fortaleza.github.io/) and other ones.

My passions include the design and implementation of full stack projects, open source stuff, indie, electronic & rock music, and also SPFC (<3). <strike>In my freetime</strike> I also study IT at Instituto Federal do Ceará.
